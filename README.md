# Sentence Classification Models in PyTorch

This repository contains PyTorch implementations of sentence classification models. Two distinct approaches are explored: 
</br></br>1. Utilizing pretrained Word2Vec embeddings with models employing average pooling, max pooling, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
</br>2. Using tokenized words and an Embedding Bag model
